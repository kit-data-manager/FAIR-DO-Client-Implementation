# FAIR DO Client Implementations

This client implementation is used to read and interpret the information record of FAIR Digital Objects (FAIR DOs) and to enable machine-actionable decisions on them. The script consists of Native_client classes, which contain abstract methods and are supposed to be used as a basis for use case specific implementations. Currently we support one exmaple use case for Machine Learning, i.e., relabeling of training data.
