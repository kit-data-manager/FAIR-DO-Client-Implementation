# FAIR DO Client Implementations

This client implementation is used to read and interpret the information record of FAIR Digital Objects (FAIR DOs) and to enable machine-actionable decisions on them. The script consists of Native_client classes, which contain abstract methods and are supposed to be used as a basis for use case specific implementations. Currently we support one exmaple use case for Machine Learning, i.e., relabeling of training data. The client connects to an instance of the Typed PID Maker to facilitate requests to the PID service, i.e., the Handle Registry, and uses the HTTP protocol for request transmission.
